- [eve](https://github.com/vercel/eve) - Vercel's agent framework. Experimental `autoModel` defaults to Gateway `typesafe-ai/jev` to pick a language model from an allowlist.
- [jev-mcp](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp) - Node MCP wrapping three cookbook patterns: `jev_verify` (citation check), `jev_screen` (prompt-injection / guardrails), `jev_find` (semantic ranking without embeddings). `npx -y github:jkudish/jev-mcp`.
- [Jev MCP (Python)](https://github.com/blakestone-x/jev-mcp) - Python MCP server: classify, score, check, match, and screen tools.
- [Jev Review MCP](https://github.com/NiazMorshed2007/jev-review) - Local-first MCP: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode get structured quality review from Jev while they write. Not the same project as [Jev Review](#applications) above.
- [typesafe-mcp](https://github.com/itsmostafa/typesafe-mcp) - Go CLI and single-binary MCP for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Codex.
- [pi-typesafe](https://github.com/DevMortimer/pi-typesafe) - Pi extension: one consented, key-managed TypeSafe client, batched `typesafe_evaluate`, offline-testable transport.
- [pi-jev](https://github.com/y0usaf/pi-jev) - Pi extension with a shadow-mode tool-call gate, output judge, and typed `jev_ask`.
- [pi-warden](https://github.com/DevMortimer/pi-warden) - Pi guardrails on pi-typesafe: held tool results instead of a dialog; write checks against a project rules file.
- [pi-jev-auto-mode](https://github.com/jomatsu/pi-jev-auto-mode) - Pi auto mode: Jev semantically approves `bash` / `write` / `edit`, and fails closed when it cannot decide.
- [Bicameral](https://github.com/AbdelStark/bicameral) - Pi coding harness: LLM writes, Jev supplies typed reflexes for policy, loop detection, and review. Explicitly not a sandbox.
- [jev-pref](https://github.com/doeixd/jev-pref) - Turn AGENTS.md preferences into a Jev-powered AI linter: project-specific semantic review rules in `jev-pref.json`, checked against hunks, staged files, or PRs, with findings fed back to your coding agent. `npx jev-pref setup`.
- [ask-jev-skill](https://github.com/shantanugoel/ask-jev-skill) - Hermes skill: ask Jev whenever the agent needs a bounded decision.
- [hermes-jev-skills](https://github.com/kerpopule/hermes-jev-skills) - Hermes pack, also for Claude Code and Codex: Jev handles model routing, skill choice, search, memory, and compaction. About 0.4 s per routing turn, and about 2.8 s to pick among 377 skills. A measured handoff digest recalled less than the plain transcript, so handoffs keep the dialogue
- [jev-system-architect](https://github.com/samtay32/jev-system-architect) - Skill that hunts for brittle semantic logic and turns it into Choice / Score / Noul boundaries.
- [augustus](https://github.com/24601/Augustus) - Unofficial agent skill for finding, building, evaluating, and improving decision-model systems with composition rules, evaluation harnesses, and bounded prompt/program optimization; TypeSafe Jev is the default hosted exemplar
- [jev-axi](https://github.com/shiftynick/jev-axi) - CLI plus Claude Code and Codex hooks: Jev scores each shell command for hazards before it runs and screens fetched text for prompt injection, with routine commands decided locally so nothing is sent
- [jev-engineering](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/jev-engineering) - Decision layer for coding agents: deterministic rules before any model call, then one Jev request, as a Claude Code hook, an MCP server, a loopback service and a shared team policy. Ships the 300-call injection test behind its own numbers.
- [Jevonian](https://github.com/xinyao27/jevonian) - Local OpenAI / Anthropic / Responses-compatible proxy where one Jev call answers both the model route and the thinking level for `jevonian/auto`, from session state (recent messages and tool results, consecutive errors, context headroom, quota, candidate capabilities, cache-switch penalties); deterministic code filters candidates and owns every threshold first, a pinned model or explicit `jevonian/<route>` skips Jev entirely, and each decision is recorded with the serving model, reason, token usage, and estimated cost.
- [jev-belay](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev-belay) - Claude Code Stop hook that checks the transcript for evidence before trusting a "done" claim, spending one four-question Jev call only when files changed with no passing check since, and failing open on every error path.
- [jev-commit](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev-commit) - Pre-commit hook where one Jev call judges whether the commit message matches the staged diff, flags debug leftovers and unmentioned work, and blocks only when it detects a credential.
- [jev-use](https://github.com/shitianfang/jev-use) - Claude Code, Codex and pi plugin: Jev answers the batched typed questions an agent loop needs, and a typed escalation contract hands writing and low-confidence steps back to the LLM
- [dsh-jev-tools](https://github.com/HorusJiang/dsh-jev-tools) - DeepSeek Harness plugin: Jev prunes oversized tool output, screens fetched pages for injected instructions, and picks which skill fits the next step, plus the jev_ask and jev_gate tools
- [slop-grader](https://github.com/lukstei/slop-grader) - Rule-based CLI and agent skill that grades text against custom rulesets for AI slop, grammar, and technical documentation quality, and guides an AI agent to auto-fix violations
- [pytest-jev](https://github.com/allebee/pytest-jev) - pytest plugin for semantic assertions on LLM output: each plain-English claim about a reply becomes a Jev Noul in one request, a claim passes at p ≥ 0.8, and failures print every claim's probability; `choice` and `score` cover routing and rubric checks
- [jgrep (kyu1204)](https://github.com/kyu1204/jgrep) - Semantic grep for code, git diffs and CSV rows: one Noul per 5-60 line chunk, 16 chunks per Jev request, grep-style file:line output and exit codes for CI lint rules written in English
- [jevgrep (allebee)](https://github.com/allebee/jevgrep) - Streaming grep by meaning for logs: asks Jev one Noul per line against a plain-English question and prints the lines at or above a threshold, including from `tail -f`
- [wellposed](https://github.com/suraj-phanindra/wellposed) - Offline linter and agent skill for Jev requests: 40 structural checks with no model call (missing none-of-the-above options, broken state paths, wrong criteria shapes), plus Jev-on-Jev checks for what structure cannot decide, with labelled corpora that score both layers.
